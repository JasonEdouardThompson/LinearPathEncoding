The light of the universe from eath's general perspective (assuming 0 pollution and obfuscation, Say the 20 AU from the sun directly upwards, and looking away from the solar system) is fairly dim. It's certainly visible to the naked eye, but the sun, moon and our fellow planets as seen from earth are all substantially brighter than anything else in the night sky. Sure, There's a few stars that show brighter than say, pluto, but on the whole, the milky way galaxy and the various nebulas and other galaxies in the night sky don't get too much brighter than they are in the remote wilderness on earths surface. This isn't to say that space can't have bright, brilliant and colorful skyscapes, just that Earth is in a relatively ""remote"" area in terms of brilliant celestial objects, and as such we'd have to travel considerable difference to see anything significantly different. The milky way itself is most likely far brighter as seen from outside (above looking at the center) or looking dead on at the ""side"" of the disk. Look into [Apparent Magnitude](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Apparent_magnitude) and [Luminosity](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Luminosity) for more.

We're talking about the perceived brightness of the Milky Way and other objects in the sky from Earth, which is by definition what Apparent Magnitude is. Granted, the *Apparent Magnitude of the Milky Way* is a bit difficult to define because there are many stars and celestial objects in the milky way that have a significantly different apparent magnitude than the overall ""backdrop"" of the galactic disc as a whole, but I digress. With regard to the percieved brightness of an object from somewhere other than earth, and comparing the relative brightness between objects, Absolute Magnitude and Luminosity are more relevant, depending on exactly what you're trying to discuss/compare, but as Absolute Magnitude is the hypothetical apparent magnitude at a given distance, the understanding of apparent magnitude is still very much relevant.
