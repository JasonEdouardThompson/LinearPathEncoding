India doesn't have the ability to send humans into space, and it will be a long time before ISRO is confident enough to do so with Indian astronauts. I was referring more to cargo delivery, technical consultancy and technology transfer. The ISRO has always been interested in entering the commercial space business - in recent years, through the Antrix Corporation (the commercial services wing of the organisation), the organisation has made huge annual profits - 13 billion Rupees (~200 million USD) in the 2013-2014 period alone, and this part of the organisation is growing rapidly. As many of the more advanced space programs begin turning to privately-owned companies like SpaceX for commercial services, I think the ISRO could become a popular alternative with its development of extremely cost-effective technologies. The ISRO also has an impressive safety/success record, especially when compared with other young space programs. So yeah, definitely not human space exploration at this stage, but I think that the ISRO could definitely grow to become a trusted and reliable partner of NASA, the ESA, and others, in the (hopefully not-too-distant) future.","cu37ial","cu4lzno","cu49blc"

A few things stand out. First Maven at lift-off was 1.75 times heavier than MOM (2500 Kg Vs 1350 Kg) and its propellant mass at lift-off was 1650 Kg Vs 850 Kg with MOM). Since India used a lower powered but its most reliable rocket to launch, MOM had to do complicated maneuvering to slowly increase its earth orbit (using the solitary 440N rocket engine on the spacecraft itself) at higher and higher speeds to finally escape earth's orbit. While MAVEN with its powerful Atlas rocket did this in one shot. On arrival MAVEN had most of its fuel intact because it hardly used any of its six 200 N engines until Mars injection. While MOM used most of it in escaping earth orbit. Secondly, Maven carried a lot more science while MOM selected a few but important science experiments. Due to the low amount of propellant left, MOMs life span is shorter and it is also in a very elliptical orbit (adjustments take fuel). This means that it spends most of the time far from Mars however one silver lining being that it is able to do full disc image captures of Mars once in a while. Bottom line, India did a spectacular job with MOM displaying world class technological prowess. But all of the economy was achieved because of indigenous manufacturing and development and the inherent lower labor costs (corresponding Lower standard of living as well) and not because of any technological breakthrough. This is good stuff but for the sake of science one has to be fair. It is inaccurate to compare MOM and MAVEN as they are two very different missions.","cu2x50o","cu3ahd8","cu2x50o"

The problem with space travel is that not many people are in love with it. They pay their taxes and get on with life but for them space travel is the stuff of Sci-Fi: it's something they'll never encounter in their lifetime themselves, probably. And that's somewhat true: as it is, that's how it'll work out for your average member of the public. But imagine if someone could show the world that we can go to space. Not just as a species, but as individuals. If we put money into space, we'll get there ourselves. It's Neil DeGrasse Tyson's ""one whole cent on the tax dollar"" thing. If NASA had been receiving that since we went to the moon, we might have gotten to Mars by now. I'm from Australia and I sit here today thinking we ***could*** have money going into addressing climate change but instead our prime minister says coal is god's gift to humanity and that the coal industry needs to be protected. And that wind turbines cause dangerous wind turbine syndrome and are a threat to public health. That's funny, coming from Australia where science literacy and awareness is pretty good. But we're being held back by corrupt politicians and poor public policy. Barring contact with a benevolent alien race -- or a mass relay, or some miraculous breakthrough in the fight against death --, the stars are probably out of my reach, but the rest of our solar system may not be. If more people realised that, and knew they could demand progress and get it, then we'd get out there. That's another reason I think Star Citizen is so popular. It's captured a lot of people's dreams, mine included, I'll admit. But it's a taste of space adventure, or space mediocrity, if that's more your thing. But, space. The dream is alive in us.

This is because the pressure of the atmosphere is lower at higher altitude (the less air around you, the less it presses in on you from all sides). Water boils more easily at lower pressure. On Mars, the pressure is so low that water boils instantly when it gets warm enough to melt, skipping from ice to gas rather than staying as a liquid.","cu2xafb","cu33aho","cu32i53"

The distinction isn't as clear as you might think, since part of content creation is things like scripts and flowgraphs to make things happen inside a game level. That said, my advice is to contribute to an existing project. A game engine encompasses a lot more than displaying graphics. For example, you need communications support for multiplayer servers, audio support for game sounds, the CryEngine supports Adobe Flash for screen overlays (health and ammo displays for example, and lots more. It's also reasonably modifiable. One team added a collision physics module, so that objects would crumple and react more realistically. Another thing the CryEngine has is a ""level editor"", which lets you edit terrain maps, objects, and all the other bits that go into a finished level. Simply by hitting ctrl-G the editor goes into game mode, and plays the current state of the level. Being able to jump in and out of play is enormously useful. The CryEngine for PC is built on DirectX primitives, but it is capable of compiling for other targets (XBox, Playstation, etc.). It may not do all that you want to do, but it does a lot. Aside from a learning experience, I think you would do better to learn one of the existing commercial engines (CryEngine, Unreal, Unity), or join one of the open-source graphics engine projects. Oh, one other thing. You need a content creation pipeline for the assets that go into the engine. I use 3dsMax for objects, and Photoshop for textures. There are other tools for audio, flash, scripting, etc., and alternates for objects and textures. Your engine either has to accept native assets as is, or provide a converter to put them in ""game ready"" form. The CryEngine supplies a converter plug-in for 3dsMax. One thing it does is ""stripify"" the triangle mesh of a 3D shape. What that means is arranging the triangles so strips of them share a common side with two common vertices. The next triangle only has to specify one new point, which makes loading the object more efficient.","cu2x50o","cu3zo22","cu3dp2a"

Space development, including exploratory missions like these, are long-term investments with unimaginable payouts. They don't bring money back in the next financial quarter, but the economic benefits produced by the innovation and discovery in space development is enormous. A significant portion of the entire industrial fabric of modern life came out of NASA's moon missions, from lasers to computer networking to manufacturing techniques and lubricants. It's almost impossible to find a more worthwhile investment than space research, pound for dollar. Exploratory missions to Mars have even greater potential. That's an entire PLANET of untapped resources, potentially equaling all the wealth on earth today over the next few centuries or millennia of development. It's even more important than that because Mars could provide a half-way point for development of mining/manufacturing operations in the asteroid belt, which contains an absolutely unbelievable amount of precious metals and minerals of every sort, utterly dwarfing those extracted from the earth's crust. The first nations and companies to begin developing Mars will have a huge advantage in claiming the biggest opportunity for growth and development in history, and prior research and reconnaissance is a vital part of that. What you're saying is equivalent to looking at an oil company sending a surveyor to scout new drilling locations and saying ""Well, there's really no monetary return.

I'm not against exploration for science purposes, I'm quite the opposite. However movies are a completely different thing, it's made completely for profit - spend $70 million, make $120 million back. Hence, it's not really fair to compare an Indian space mission to a Hollywood movie because a movie's budget might be huge because presumably the more you spend = better movie = greater profits whereas a space mission there's no return profit. For a movie, the money spent is an *investment* to make more money whereas for a space mission, the money spend is essentially gone. Hence, even if an Indian space mission costs say, $60 million and is below a Hollywood movie at say, $80 million, the Indian space mission was still more expensive since they don't get the money back.","cu2x50o","cu372g9","cu34yb4"

The two Geographic poles are where the Earth's axis of rotation meets the surface while the Geomagnetic poles are where the Earth's magnetic dipole meets the surface. To further confuse things, magnetically speaking, the South geomagnetic pole is actually the North pole of the Earth’s magnetic field. The two Magnetic poles are where geomagnetic field lines point vertically into the ground. The two Celestial poles are imaginary points in the sky, towards which the Earth’s axes of rotation (or geographic poles) point. The North Pole of Inaccessibility is the point in the Arctic Ocean furthest from land and the South Pole of Inaccessibility is the point on the Antarctic continent furthest from the ocean. There is a bust of Lenin at the South Pole of Inaccessibility which was placed on the top of a Soviet hut by Russian explorers 48 years ago. It is larger than life and made of plastic.

[they give us a big update on the FPS part EVERY friday](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/14903-Star-Marine-Status-Update) until the blockers are resolved, and a massive 5-7 page status report at the end of every month on the whole game. this is in addition to 3-4 hours of video every week too (Arround the verse, 10 questions for the chairman, Reverse the verse, and Bugsmashers are most of their weekly ""shows"") long story is the character animation is actually why they delayed the ""FPS module until probably next month. all the animations are unified first/third person so they dont cheat using ""flying player camera with floaty arms connected to a hover torso"" like most games do. having it be this way makes it more complex and they are having to take quite a bit longer with it. add in all the extra zero G animation and it becomes quite the load of work to adjust all those different animation situations.","cu2x50o","cu3oe24","cu3fs3l"

Of course there is plenty of injustice in the workplace even in America but there is a mechanism in place for proper grievance redressal. But at the same time I feel like people are more vocal and more aware of their worth in America than in India. People here could be treated very badly especially in the private sector and especially the lower rung of the people. There are no labor laws in place to protect them.

So if you throw a bunch of dust out into space, it'll clump together at the center due to gravity, but it will also form a disk of dust around the clump. The disk is stuff that has angular momentum, and forms an orbit. Anything with an orbit off-kilter with the disk gets pulled out of orbit by the disk, and adjusts the disk's orbit a little. Eventually everything balances out and everything has either fallen into the center mass or is in a stable orbit. In the solar system, the disk formed planets which went through their own gravity and disk-forming dance. But by then the overall spin of all the stuff has been established. That's why all the planets are spinning around the sun in the same direction. Also why **they rotate in the same direction* and in the same plane**. So if you're on earth and calling up your buddy on mars, and you tell him to look north, he'll see the same stars that you're looking at.

So you're off to the kind of start I expected. &gt; I'll break it down for you Please do.. I hear it's dangerous to try and understand this kind of information without having an internet warrior explain it to you. &gt; ""Poverty"", as defined by the article about India, is defined as ""having income of less than $1.25 a day"". Okay cool. &gt;In the United States, ""poverty"" is defined by the US Census bureau is a complex calculation based upon geography, family size, and other factors, but to simply-- in 2013, a family of five was under the poverty line if it earned as having income less than $28,298. That's more than $1.25 a day. So you're comparing apples and oranges. Why silly me... for a minute here I thought I was comparing 1960's USA poverty levels to present day Indian poverty levels... Good job on not understanding the basis of this conversation. I should probably stop reading here because the level of stupidity in your post has reached a critical state, but I'll humor you and keep reading. &gt; Any right thinking person who has seen the world would never make a ludicrous claim that 1960s US had comparable poverty as India today. It's a laughable claim coming from somebody who is woefully uninformed. Coming from the guy who hasn't disproved anything and compared present day US poverty levels to present day poverty levels in India... that's not what the discussion was about bud. Talk about woefully uninformed and a laughable attempt at trying to look smart.. &gt; By the way, I was born in 1952, and part of my job involves traveling the world. If that seems far fetched, it just speaks to the narrow band of your worldview. I'm gonna go ahead and say ""I think you're just making that up."" For someone who claims to be an all knowing source on poverty and claims to have lived in 1960's US and present day India.. you don't know the first thing about the topic at hand. Please do us all a favor and just admit that your initial comment was idiotic and that you probably shouldn't be commenting on topics you know nothing about.","cu37qm9","cu3ip44","cu3i7u0"

I think I had ""learned"" it a few times previously, but it never really clicked until it was explained to me that way. Obviously it's a bit more complicated than that in reality (isn't everything?) and that is really in the most basic terms, but it's a good way to visualize and understand the relationship between temperature and pressure *(edit: also volume)* in a gasses and (some?) liquids. **EDIT** I forgot to mention that in my example, V (volume) remains constant. The way I learned it was that whichever variable is held constant is used as a sort of ""pivot point"" on the equation itself. So if volume is constant, you visualize V as a pivot point. Therefore, raising the pressure decreases the temperature and vice versa. Like a see-saw. Likewise, if you were to hold Pressure as a constant (visualize it as a pivot point) and increase volume, then temperature needed also increases. If you decrease temperature, then the volume also decreases. Hope that makes sense. It's difficult to explain without drawing a picture or demonstrating it in person. If it's unclear, let me know and I can try to explain it better.","cu2xafb","cu3heg3","cu3h4hl"

Employees don't complain and their families dont either. In fact they are so used to it that they don't even know that they deserve time off. Since the competition is so fierce in every single field and no government back up of any kind people are used to working extremely hard just to get by or maintain a decent standard of living. Saturdays aren't off for most of the working population. It's a six day work week. Also there is no overtime. You get paid a fixed amount at the end of the month and you are expected to do whatever your boss asks. It's a way of life here which is unimaginable to most of the workforce in USA.

That's just the thing. I don't want to be a debbie-downer here, but everyone keeps saying how India did this all themselves and so forth, but they didn't. They built upon preexisting technologies and reused those ideas and designs. I mean, India didn't invent their deep space network from scratch, they built upon and adopted technology and ideas from NASA and ESA. And that's only a single thing. Do you think they invented the chemical rockets used to get them to mars? Of course they didn't. Decades of old research (and mistakes) from Russia, America, Europe went into that, otherwise India would have spent a couple decades blowing up their rockets before they got it right like the rest of us. According [to wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Orbiter_Mission), India **isn't** doing this alone, they have assistance from NASA: ""*Despite the US federal government shutdown, NASA reaffirmed on 5 October 2013 it would still provide communications and navigation support to the mission.*"" I praise India for what they've done, but let's not pretend they're breaking any science here. This mission, according to wikipedia, was a demonstration and a test. They have a way to go before they're going to be bringing us new science.

Then there's two weeks paid vacation in addition to that. That's government mandated. If you live close to your family, which you will mostly, you take days off for family engagements.

You know how the human eye can see 3 colors (red green and blue), and when combined they make up the other colors we can perceive? Spacecraft cameras are usually sensitive to different colors other than red, green and blue (the Opportunity mars rover has sensitivity to 6 different colors), and so the pictures they take usually need to be adjusted to appear as they would to the human eye. There's different ways of doing that and different types of cameras, and they all produce slightly different color balances. Here the dark gray sand stands out very clearly as blue/black because of how those colors have been mixed, but in reality most of it would be a fairly dusty red. It helps the geologists visually identify things that are interesting to them rather than stare at the low-contrast red that our natural eyes are limited to. See here Mars is not so high-contrast: https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7170/6733326721_0202d458b0_b.jpg &gt;And what does the N stand for, sir? Martian north.","cu2zlx1","cu32vo5","cu32gsd"

There aren't just huge asteroids randomly shooting through space. The asteroids near us are all in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, in fixed orbits, like all massive objects in the solar system. If one gets knocked out of its orbit, it may head our way. But asteroids don't often get knocked out of their orbit--there are great distances between the asteroids, and it is extremely unlikely they will collide and knock each other off orbit.","cu2x50o","cu2zotg","cu2yo99"

Kids around the world, would've been inspired after watching Interstellar. Kinda like what Star Wars was to its generation. Elon Musk is a strong believer in popularizing science and technology through unconventional means, which can be often seen as ""gimmicks"". He once planned on sending mice on Mars, making a breeding colony. Then planned on establishing a greenhouse on Mars, and live stream that to Earth. Sadly they weren't feasible. But inspiring the masses about great scientific achievements is an important aspect of media and culture. A better example in these comparisons would be, Fast and Furious/ Transformers movies whose sole existence is to earn money.

But also, notice their Agricultural output which has improved significantly. In the cities, you do see the levels of poverty such that you have never seen here (US), but you are not comparing it to the poverty levels of the 70s and the 80s. Too lazy (and full) on Fri evening to pull sources. This has positively affected the entire populace.

As amazing as HiRISE is (it's the [largest telescope we've sent to another planet](http://mars.nasa.gov/mro/images/PIA07087.jpg)), it's just one telescope. It produces hi-resolution image strips, and given the limitations (in terms of time, logistics, data-rate, etc.), HiRISE has only imaged about 1% of the surface of Mars. The next step down in resolution is CTX (Context Camera), also onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). If you un-click ""HiRISE"" in that map above, and click ""CTX"", you can get nice high resolution (~6 m/pixel) images of the entire planet.

We talk a lot about how we need more living space and colonies etc. but I think a lot of this is the product of science fiction. In reality mars is a rock devoid of life and oxygen and getting there and doing anything on it will be nothing but an uphill battle-- and beyond that even more risks. What is the potential if we manage to colonize mars? Or any other planet for that matter. Hell the nearest planets that MAY have water are multi light years away. Helios 2 moved at 157 thousand miles per hour. speed of light is 670,000 thousand miles per hour. It's likely we will never be able to leave earth. At least until we develop some method of moving faster or a way to create a living city of people that is self sustaining on a spacecraft","cu2x50o","cu2zsxb","cu2y1og"

Besides, most Indian government organisations like this one or nuclear research or chemicals research provide huge residential facilities for their employees with every aspect of their life massively subsidized. My father in law worked his whole life in one of these, and when he retired four years ago he was paying the equivalent of 15 USD(not a typo) a month as rent for a three bedroom apartment. Apparently there was some clause due to which they couldn't just give it to employees. He got to put three kids through college almost for free. All hospital care is free too and if the residential hospital doesn't have what is needed, the government/organisation will put employees in outside hospitals at its own expense. These people are not compelled to work 18 hours a day, and they are extremely well taken care of, is what I am saying. Pay is not bad either (by Indian standards)","cu2x50o","cu3qlpb","cu33c21"
