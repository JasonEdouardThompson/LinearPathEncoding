The other possibility is that it's not greater, so pluto falls into the earth. This would depend on the mass between earth and pluto, and partially the mass of the sun. It would also depend on earth's speed, and the distance between earth and pluto. Which side pluto ends up on is also probably relevant. I think it also depends on how big earth and Pluto's radius is but I'm not sure. So I just reread the question and it says appear on the planets surface. I'm not sure on that one, I'm guessing it would sink into the earth.","ctc65la","ctd1oeh","ctc65la"

Either throwing us further in to space and thusly to a freezing death or cause us to get even closer to the sun. The change in orbit could be so abrupt that it causes the moon's orbit to change drastically. Either completely flinging the moon away or causing the moon to whip outward only to be drawn back to earth much more violently possibly colliding with the earth (again) or creating a very oblong orbit in which the moon gets closer and further away as it orbits.

I can imagine the modelling to figure out what it would all look like afterwards would be rather intensive/specialised.

The Stadium also brings revenue into the community and local business' profit from this. So you could say that the Stadium in itself is a silly idea because why put money into sports, right? But it makes money for other people. Which in turn helps the poor. Companies and this Stadium's owners will give a 15% portion to charity as a tax write off.

Pluto would fairly promptly fall apart and fall towards the Earth's surface and deliver energy equivalent to a planet size mass falling from 750 miles. In addition, the point of contact would be under enormous force and deformation of the earth's crust would be substantial - extending down a few hundred miles at least. This would be catastrophic - not as catastrophic as having Pluto collide with Earth at orbital velocities but way above that required to destroy everything. A collision at orbital velocities would add enough energy to put a mass like Pluto back into space at orbital escape speeds - basically take the first case and add a scoop of Earth the size of Pluto thrown up as a first approximation. But even placing Pluto on the surface represents an enormous amount of gravitational potential energy that will be liberated.

According to this resolution, there are three main conditions for an object to be considered a ""planet"": 1. The object must be in orbit around the Sun. 2. The object must be massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity. More specifically, its own gravity should pull it into a shape of hydrostatic equilibrium. 3. It must have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. Pluto fails to meet the third condition, because its mass is only 0.07 times that of the mass of the other objects in its orbit (Earth's mass, by contrast, is 1.7 million times the remaining mass in its own orbit).","ctc4xtk","ctcb0nf","ctcaw89"

So if by ""at rest"" you mean relative to the center of the Earth... Pluto has 0 speed while the Earth rotates under it, then the result would be that of Pluto grazing the surface at 1700kph, or about mach 1.4. That would gouge out a huge swath of the surface that would probably take out much of India and Africa with it. The relative scraping effect would fling debris much farther out than a lot of people are probably imagining. If by ""at rest"" you mean relative to the surface of the Earth, then Pluto is flying past the Earth at 1700kph exactly matching Earth's surface velocity at point of contact, then my guess is the following: Pluto would become a conflicted body... as a whole, it would attempt to maintain its tangential trajectory and begin to rise off the surface for a while before falling down again onto the Earth. This scenario involves a lot more energy and would ultimately liquefy much of the surface of the Earth for a while (much like when our moon was created). However, both bodies are somewhat plastic at the scale of gravitational tidal forces involved, so only part of Pluto would rise into the air. Some of Australia would get pulled up by Pluto along with much of the surrounding sea water and then spring back down again onto the Earth. Pluto's lower parts would partially rip apart and fall down onto the Earth while much of the upper half would try to orbit around the Earth in the direction of Earth's rotation. That orbit would be elliptical and periodically recontact the Earth probably on a period somewhere around a day perhaps. I'm not sure what the apogee would be. I could try to guestimate that later if I get some time. Pluto would leave a ring of debris in space and pieces would rain down into the atmosphere for years. Over the next few days the atmosphere would become so hot from debris raining down that it would bake most everything on the surface like a pizza oven. The Earth would bulge and wobble for days or weeks killing everyone and everything left. Everyone who wasn't cooked by the atmosphere would be crushed in Earthquakes or buried or suffocated by massive volcanism. In the end, Earth would be a black ball laced with lakes and rivers of lava for a while and then would just go black and largely lifeless like it was in its primordial days. Traces of robust bacteria might survive. I'm assuming that Pluto is mostly a rocky body and not entirely made of ices. The dynamics would be very similar anyway, but perhaps Pluto would disperse and break up more readily if it were like a giant iceball. Those are my best guesses.","ctc65la","ctch069","ctc65la"

As there's a lot of ice on Pluto, its density would likely be much less than Earth's surface, and so I'd imagine the impact of it on Australia (for example) would be less catastrophic than if its whole mass was rocky. Assuming you just magicked Pluto above Australia like in the picture, I'd predict that the ice would crack and crumble down over the hot continent, with the fine ice particles melting and the large shards wreaking havoc. The rocky core might form a new Uluru, but I don't think many people would be able to see it in a great hurry as there would be earthquakes and volcano eruptions (caused by the impact) and flooding (caused by the melting ice), not to mention the crushing and destruction of a large part (or all?) of Australia.

Earth's parameter at 1 AU is 1.5x10^(5), so at 40 AU it would be 600. That's similar to Mars, and still more than two orders of magnitude above the minimum it would take to clear its orbit. I don't know what you mean by the other metric, since Soter's planetary discriminant is useless in this case (if you moved Jupiter to Pluto's orbit, it won't have cleared its orbit since Neptune is there). The reason Pluto hasn't cleared its orbit is due to its mass (combined with its distance from the Sun). It didn't acquire enough mass to be able to scatter or absorb most of the other objects in its orbital path. That would be true even if Neptune hadn't captured it in a 3:2 resonance.","ctc4xtk","ctd20c3","ctd0q7y"

Australia would be boned for sure. the entire population would be crushed under Pluto or drown under tidal waves that would be pulled in by pluto's gravity. But I think the rest of the world would likely only notice the tidal changes. This could be severe for many coastal cities and villages on other continents, but this is entirely an effect of gravity, not an impact that would make insanely huge tsunamis. Pluto is 70% rock and 30% ice, with most of the ice on the surface. I suspect the ice would eventually melt, but I can't say exactly how the rocky core might break apart under Earth's gravity. I doubt instantly, very likely over time it would just break down and bury Australia and flood our oceans with new water. As for the 90% nitrogen atmosphere, I doubt that would be a big deal in the long run, considering Earth's atmosphere is already 80% nitrogen.","ctc65la","ctcf05q","ctc65la"

Most likely we would see failure along fault and joint planes in the rock and a sloughing of surficial material off the sides of Pluto.

Feel free to ignore me: 1.5x10^29 Joules appears to use a basic calculation for gravitational potential energy: Energy = Mass * Acceleration due to Gravity * Height. There are some problems with this: 1) It assumes that gravitational force is constant, which is fine for small height ranges but not accurate at 750 miles up. For that you should use: Energy = The integral from the surface of the earth to the altitude of Pluto's center of (Universal Gravitational Constant * Mass of Earth * Mass of Pluto)/Distance from center of Earth to center of Pluto. 2) Since Pluto is big enough for parts of it to be at significantly different altitudes, you would have to do some integration for the change in gravity over the height as well as the mass of Pluto at each infinitesimal altitude. To do that you'd have to consider that each infinitesimal slice of Pluto's mass would be defined as the intersection of two spheres (essentially the segment of Pluto that intersects with the surface of the sphere defined by the center of the Earth and the distance from the center to the altitude). On top of that you'd have to integrate over the height of the fall. Lots of calculus. 3) If we assume that ""resting on the surface with an initial velocity of zero"" means that Pluto isn't moving with respect to Australia, that means that Pluto would be following the rotation of the Earth. That means it would be experiencing a centrifugal force from the frame of reference of Earth's surface. Part of that would be opposed to gravity and reducing the force of the impact, but since Australia is south of the equator a component of the force would point north. So in addition to smashing downward, Pluto would also be rolling north a little bit. Of course that wouldn't substantially affect the energy of the impact; I just thought it was interesting. Of course all of that is less than trivial from the perspective of the average person on Earth. They're all very dead either way, and as an engineer I applaud your ""close enough to be accurate"" approximation.","ctc65la","ctcxrb5","ctcbrkg"

Over time, most of this stuff has either been flung away (mainly by Jupiter) or swept up by the planets, moons, etc. (Pluto numbers among these, of course.) A planet's gravity will divert objects in motion if said object gets close enough, but it will not ""suck them in"". If that were true, shit would constantly be hitting the Sun. (It isn't.) Instead, things just orbit it, or at least follow parabolic trajectories in the solar system. Jupiter does this too, but to a lesser extent.

The Earth's crust is compressible and likely the instant appearance would result in initial massive earthquakes as the crust settled to relieve stress. A bigger concern would be that Pluto is round. Presuming it could hold up to Earth's gravitation and not immediately crack it would probably roll off Australia to settle to a lower gravitational potential in an ocean. That would probably send most of the liquid from the ocean up over the nearby continents in the form of massive tidal waves. Pluto is frozen with enough mass to stay frozen for a very long time. It would probably crack under stress though eventually and release massive amounts of gasses and fluids onto the Earth's surface. This would likely flood the Earth with fluid long before completely melting resulting in a water-world except that the fluid would be a liquid state methane. Pluto wouldn't have enough mass to truly distort the Earth's rotation or send the moon into us but it would create a wobble. More worrisome is the fact that we'd all be dead from breathing in massive amounts of methane and carbon monoxide emanating from the beast as well as likely being flooded with cold liquid methane.

The gravitational pull on them coming from the center of the Earth is 15 times the pull coming from the center of Pluto. That means they will start falling down towards the Earth, from 750 miles up. (The strength of the rock is nowhere near high enough to resist gravity.) From that height, they will reach a speed of 4 km/s (~Mach 12) as they hit the ground. You can also apply this to the middle parts of Pluto, although they will have some rock/ice under them that will be compressed and pushed down. At planetary scales, even rock behaves mostly like a liquid.

Pluto's mass is approx. 1.31 * 10^22 kg. Grav acc is 9.806 m/s^2. Now 'height' has me a little lost. You're saying Pluto spawns just touching the Earth's surface. Can we just generalise its height to the distance of its centre to the Earth's surface? If so, its mean radius is 1185 kilometres. Plugging that into Google's calculator gives me 1.5222344e+26 God dammit mathematicians. What the hell is the e for? I don't know what that means. Couldn't you just give me a power?
