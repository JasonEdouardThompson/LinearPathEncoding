My neck has never fully recovered, but what really helped was getting the monitor up high. I'm not one for any specific posture, however, keeping my head up and not hunched over a laptop is important. If you have to work on a laptop monitor I'd suggest getting a stand: http://i.imgur.com/o7ECdxt.jpg If you work at a company you can request equipment like that. Just make sure to use the word ergonomic, working condition and health, and you're sure to get the equipment you need. Usually its just a couple of hours of work in expenses. Regularly do stretches also helps. I continuously do extreme movements. Not in the fast sense, but turning my head as far as it can, move arms around as far as they go etc. Probably looks wierd, but better than ruining my neck/shoulders more. Finally ctrl-scroll is awesome. Any browser should support zooming in and out. Most IDEs or text editors supports it or can be configured to support it. This means you don't have to have your monitor up in your face all the time. Just avoid hunching over your computer.","ctrh8cn","ctrh8cn","3fqz77"

I've had all kinds of RSI injuries in my days - wrist pain, back pain, elbow pain, you name it. I just thought this was a fact of life and tried to counteract it with exercise, ergonomic equipment, taking frequent breaks and so on. This helped, but it felt like I was just constantly fighting off symptoms instead of solving the problem. One day I heard that Google employees could choose to get an exercise ball instead of a regular office chair. Thinking this was just crazy enough to work I got one and - just like that - all my RSI problems went away. I can now sit in front of the computer for a seemingly unlimited amount of time without any pain whatsoever. (I guess it's still debatable if sitting for unlimited time in front of a computer is a good thing) I don't know if this will work for everyone, but for me it was a life-saver. Anyhow, exercise balls are like a tenth of the price of an ergonomic chair, so it won't hurt to try. The one caveat is that you need an adjustable desk as well, but that's true no matter how you sit.","ctsbjhq","ctsbjhq","3fqz77"

They will pretty much eliminate eye strain. 2. For overall health, a good diet and exercise are needed. A standing desk or a high-quality chair will help quite a bit. I have a standing desk, and I really like it. 3. Most programmers (including myself) consume a constant supply of caffeine, which feels nice, but probably isn't great for one's health.

The text should be large enough for her not to squint. If she has glasses, have her check out terminal glasses (not sure if this is the right term). Have her try a dark themed editor/desktop environment. Posture is very important as is screen, keyboard and mouse position. These thinks are well explained of the Internet. She should strive for standing up every thirty minutes, a couple of minutes is enough, the idea is to break the monotony. I do neck, shoulder and lower arm mobility stretches every 40 minutes, I have problems with tension in those areas. 30 minute walks every day really help a lot, preferably outdoors. If she can find the time hitting the gym two maybe three times a week is very good. Focus should be on core strength if she doesn't follow a program.

Alright, well I've been into exercise for quite a few years now. But only over the past 3 months have I taken it to some seriously new levels in regard to diet and exercise. First: Diet. I snack a lot throughout the day. On healthy stuff like yogurt, fruit, carrots, etc. And I drink a lot of water. This helps me get a lot of nutritious food throughout the day and makes me get out of my office chair quite a bit as well. Second: Exercise: I exercise 4 or 5 times a week. Usually it's 2 days on, one day off. If it's a weekday, I go at lunch. I bring a gym back with me that has everything I need; clothes, towel, etc. Third: Sleep. Though this kind of goes hand in hand with exercise (if you exercise, you feel more tired at the end of the day and will eventually sleep better). It's very important. 7-8 hours is usually what I get every night. Helps with energy levels, alertness, and so much more. All of this put together ensures that I don't just sit down all day every day from 9 to 5 all white eating/feeling like shit. Happy to report I'm in the best shape I've ever been and I've never felt more sharp in mind and focus.","ctr8380","ctr8380","3fqz77"

"Alithinos","hipstergrandpa","2015-08-05 12:55:53","2015-08-05 12:55:53","1","198","Regarding the eyes, one thing is to calibrate the monitor. Use the Windows built in tool for that. Most monitors are uncalibrated, and not only they don't show colors as they are supposed to be, but usually, they are also more bright and emmit more light. More light that gets in the eyes and fatigues them. Second, there are special protective glasses for computer monitor radiation. These are not glasses that make people see if they can't see, but glasses that filter an amount of the radiation emmited from monitors, so a less amount reaches the eyes. If someone already wears glasses for myopia or something, he or she can ask the shop who made them to add the computer screen protection layer on them, so the person doesn't have to wear two sets of glasses one over the other. Now an idea is to take breaks. Since working on the computer have you sitting a lot of hours in front of it, it would be a good idea to go outside for a walk everyday, for about an hour or maybe 2 hours. Tell her to add a daily walk in her daily schedule. I personally walk 3-4 kilometers every day.","ctrwiy1","ctrwiy1","3fqz77"

There is a lot of variation in theory and practice, so you really need to shop around a bit, but once you find a good one, it will change your life if you're willing to do the work. My chiro is all about nerve and skeletal structure, and has helped me tremendously with posture and back problems. I've also read that strengthening the back muscles is the way to relieve back pain, although I know you said your problem is with your neck. If you've ever been in a car accident and not treated it, your neck may be misaligned.","ctrdccb","ctrlm0b","ctrdccb"

Likely she is having to get too close to the screen or turn up the brightness/contrast too much because she needs glasses. Make sure the screen is also properly adjusted as well, she could also try a program called flux, if that helps you might be able to get away with just some gunnar's or other blue light filter glasses. As far as the other aspects go there are some really good things you can do from a comfort perspective. First while a mechanical keyboard will improve it a lot the best thing you could get is actually a really good wrist rest. If you have problems with the mouse hand some people have had great success with a trackball or a vertical mouse. The other is as a general rule I tend to stand up about once an hour and walk around a bit, get a coffee or something. I find just a little timer works well for this. If I am in the zone rather than get up and walk I will get up do a few squats/mini exercises. I actually find that it gets the blood flowing well and actually helps when walking away might break my flow.","ctrwwt1","ctrwwt1","3fqz77"

Turns out it's worth it if you spend 8 hours or more a day just staring at it. The strain on my eyes using a retina display laptop is less than using a larger poorer quality screen on a monitor. 2) Make sure to get the right prescription for glasses or contacts. If it's glasses get the coating and quality lenses. I like Oakley digital glass. It's much better than the standard PC lenses. 3) Stand up and walk around every hour to two. I refill my water every hour or so whether I need it or not. 4) Exercise away from the computer. I like to cycle and grapple (jiu jitsu). This will keep the rest of your body healthy and strong to support you. 5) Get a great chair. A high quality chair with the right back support can save a back. Alternatively a standing desk. 6) Make sure the monitor and keyboard are in good positions. Getting your wrists and neck all cricked up will be painful. That's how I do it at least.

Your spine and your back muscles are important for so much more than you'd expect - I got a toothache because of knots and tension in my coat-hanger muscles (changes the way you move and rest, which starts causing jaw issues such as feeling toothache-like pain when you open and close your mouth). I also have no feeling to the right of my spine, over the skin of my trapezius. I'm 21 and exercise every day... Get a chair with armrests and lumbar support, make sure good posture is comfy so you stay in it (might take some getting used to but still), adjustable height to keep your forearms parallel, raise your computer monitor to discourage looking down and forward head posture, get a separate keyboard and mouse to use at home if you have a laptop, get up and stretch every 30-60 min (or at least go pee or something that changes bloodflow), etc. This is overkill for a lot of people but they're all things I need for any length of time now or I'm in a lot of pain. I think what did it was using my laptop in my lap, curled up on the couch so much - very severe downward-looking posture. This stuff is really important if you're doing computer work, since most us spend leisure time on the computer too... It was a big negative for me when I transitioned from painting and ink illustration to digital stuff. If her eyes are the worst part, make sure she has a bigger monitor and isn't reading itty bitty text if it's sized for laptop-distance but pushed back to monitor distance on a stand etc. There are also glasses with coatings that reduce eyestrain (gunnars? I think? is one brand) that work really well for my boyfriend, but I don't get eyes train so idk what brings me the most relief is taking breaks and moving often, and focusing my eyes on something far away and something close for some time. also, if your gf doesn't wear glasses, now is the time to get her eyes checked again - eyesight changes throughout your life and many people with mild myopia can ignore it or focus over it until they start doing intensive things like reading music or code all day.","cts0xca","cts0xca","3fqz77"

I needed glasses for using computers a good 15 years before I needed them for anything else. The other issue is not blinking enough - sitting in front of a screen slows your blinking down a lot, so make effort to blink if you are feeling issues with eyes and leave the screen for 10 mins (follow standard advise and take breaks every so often anyway). Also makes sure you have things set-up to be comfortable – no reflections of lights/windows in the screen, seating and desk correctly positioned – worth googling for workplace advice on using computers,","ctrevi3","ctrevi3","3fqz77"

Back in the CRT days there would be some dryness but I haven't used a CRT monitor in more than 10 years. Maybe she should get her eyes checked as she might need glasses? The other health concerns are relevant for me, though. My hands are always pretty sore from repetitive stress. Not bad enough to really affect my life but enough that there is pain. I've tried different keyboards and mice and trackpads and seating positions and nothing really helps. I wish I had an answer for this one. But everyone does need to stand up regularly, take a walk, do some stretches, etc. There is a lot of talk about working while standing up, or some even go to the extreme of having little treadmills to walk on while working. But you really just have to incorporate exercise into your life. You should try to walk (say, to work) as much as possible. Take the stairs every time there's a chance. Do some cardio that you enjoy like jogging, or biking, or rowing. Maybe pick up an athletic hobby you enjoy and can play once a week (tennis, racquetball, basketball, ultimate, etc). And learn portion control. Even with added exercise you're still going to be sedentary most of the day. Learn to eat as much as you need to not be hungry and not need to feel full after every meal. Drink lots of water (and very little of anything else) and eat lots of fresh fruits and nuts and vegetables. Hope this helps!","ctral84","ctral84","3fqz77"
