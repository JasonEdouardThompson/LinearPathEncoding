It's just a shame because while the Martian atmosphere can create winds high enough to blow dust off the panels, you're at the mercy of when it decides to do so. Spirit, if I recall correctly, died because it got stuck at a sub-optimal angle to the Sun for the winter. I also recall that dust on the panels aggravated the problem quite badly, and if the panels had been clean, Spirit had a much higher chance of keeping itself warm for the winter and waking up in the summer. The idea of using acoustics to, I assume, vibrate the panels is genius! I had not even considered that option. Goes to show why I don't work at NASA. Hopefully I will someday, though!

I know they seem cheesy because you have them in your garage and use them for all kind of mundane tasks, but the fact is, they work awesome. As for why cables like that are exposed, I am not exactly sure but in engineering often times, less is more. Meaning if leaving the cables exposed on the surface is a more simplistic approach, it is probably best. Routing them in other more complex ways introduces additional pinch points, potential problems etc...

I believe it was estimated to run at full necessary power for 15 years. Half life of plutonium 238 is 87 years, so after 87 years it will be producing half the heating power. But there is also degradation of the batteries and power converters. Voyager 1 (launched in 1977) is using the same kind of power source and its power dropped from 470W to 255W by 2015. We can expect similar effects for Curiosity. It's still better than solar panels because for those the usual estimation is 50% drop in power generation after 10 years. Not to mention dust which covers them on mars, making it even worse.","ctzb79y","ctzfheg","ctzecjc"

Curiosity is powered by a radioisotope thermal generator, basically a nuclear battery, so it doesn't rely on the Sun for power). About humans, you can technically get some to Mars right now, but there are still a number of unsolved issues: 1. Travelling interplanetary space for nine months exposes astronauts to an amount of radiation higher than they're allowed to be exposed for their whole career by NASA policy, so any plan to send humans to Mars must provide enough shielding. Passive shielding (basically thickening the walls of the spaceship) increases the payload to lift off Earth beyond the economically feasible (the heavier the spacecraft, the more fuel you need, and more fuel means a heavier spacecraft, so it's a positive feedback), unless we invent cheaper rockets (SpaceX is working on it). Active shielding (eg. an artificial magnetic field around the spacecraft) is being investigated upon IIRC. 2. We don't have enough data on how the human body copes with such long stays in zero G: missions to the ISS last six months at most. But Scott Kelly, currently on the ISS, is the first astronaut that will stay a whole year in space, so that will give us some insight. 3. Most importantly, there's currently no feasible way to return to Earth. On the Moon it's easier because it's small and has no atmosphere, but doing it the Apollo way on Mars would require impossible amounts of fuel.","ctzbv6t","cu0h52f","cu05u6c"

In winter, near the poles temperatures can get down to minus 195 degrees F (minus 125 degrees C). A summer day on Mars may get up to 70 degrees F (20 degrees C) near the equator, but at night the temperature can plummet to about minus 100 degrees F (minus 73 C). Frost forms on the rocks at night, but as dawn approaches and the air gets warmer, the frost turns to vapor, and there is 100 percent humidity until it evaporates.

I have faith in them &amp; in all honesty, they have done a fantastic job with keeping it in the shape it is currently in due to it being, as you said, in an area where the terrain was unexpected. &gt;and you say it's been going for three years. time has little to do with the damage. the rover has travelled less than 30 miles, so the damage was entirely due to the design of the vehicle and the unexpected geology.

It's a very active page and I can't believe it's as big as it is now. If you would like to check it out, go to (facebook dot com)/marscuriosityimages. (I had to type it like that because the bot will delete the post if it contains a Facebook link). James' work is incredible. I did my own version of this selfie, and while he did a better job than me, I seem to be the only one who has removed most of the dust particles on the lens.

The problems come from how long it takes to get there and back. The constant high-ish background radiation puts people at risk of cancer over the course of years. Most colonization plans have us living underground at first because a meter or two of plain old dirt makes it essentially a non-issue. Occasionally the Sun lets off large directional energy bursts, so interplanetary craft and surface landers would need to have some well shielded (and thus very very heavy) areas for astronauts to wait those out in.

Engineers began driving the rover backwards, dragging the dead wheel. Although this resulted in changes to driving techniques, the dragging effect became a useful tool, partially clearing away soil on the surface as the rover traveled, thus allowing areas to be imaged that would normally be inaccessible. However, in mid-December 2009, to the surprise of the engineers, the right front wheel showed slight movement in a wheel-test on sol 2113 and clearly rotated with normal resistance on three of four wheel-tests on sol 2117, but stalled on the fourth. On sols 2100–2101 (Nov 29, 2009), the right rear wheel also stalled and remained inoperable for the remainder of the mission.""","ctyy6q7","ctz1pab","ctyzamt"

We get so caught up in the science that we forget we need to show people *why* these things are important. You'll never win the hearts and minds of the public at large but there are a ton of us who were on the fence about our careers before this project. One of the scientists who was at the head of the project came to speak with us (my department is space related) and said that NASA was planning on keeping the entire process hush-hush. They wanted it to fly under the radar so in case it went poorly the public wouldn't say, ""look at NASA wasting all that money."" He told them that they were doing pretty much the opposite of what they should be doing. He pushed them to go the opposite direction and make it a big deal and garner as much attention as possible. And it worked. Curiosity's first images were what gave me the final push to go to graduate school in engineering. I've talked to several other students, undergrad and grad, who said the same thing. Anthropomorphizing the rovers and getting a ton of pictures (the easiest media to consume and definitely in line with the times) is one of the smartest things NASA has done in recent times.

So, when it comes to presenting images of Mars, do you want the accurate version, or the false version the way the human eye would see it? If you choose the first, you get the criticism that Mars would not look like that if you were actually standing there. If you choose the second, then you get the criticism that you've fake photoshopped it and are lying to your audience. It gets even more complex when images are taken not using RGB filters, but include something else like infra red or ultraviolet. Whatever you do then, someone will complain it isn't accurate.

The rover closes its lens cover for what it believes to be the last time as it looks up towards Earth, where its master is. ""I hope...I did...a good job...I....love....y"" and it fades to black. Forward to some years later: ""hhh....hey....that....tickles....come on....that....TICKLES?!?!?!?!"" I CAN SEE! I AM AWAKE!"" it jumps up and drives around in fast circles, almost depleting its batteries again. Looking around, it sees an incredibly advanced, futuristic looking rover equipped with a brush and compressed atmosphere jet. The new rover cleaned off the solar panels of the old rover that had ""died"" and re-booted the little guy. Unfortunately, its power was off for so long that it lost all its memories. The old and new rover set out to recover the data drives that it had left as backups when it realized it was going to die. With the new rover to clean off the old rover's solar panels, the old rover can live almost indefinitely. There's just one problem: the new rover isn't powered by solar panels, it's powered by RTG, and it's already been looking for the old rover for about 10 years.
