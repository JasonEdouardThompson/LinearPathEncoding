Clearly visible are the re-boosts which suddenly increase the height, and the gradual decay in between. The height is averaged over one orbit, and the gradual decrease is caused by atmospheric drag.

For example, increased solar activity can cause the upper atmosphere to 'swell' a bit, which increases drag on the ISS and causes its orbit to decay quicker. But based on the chart at the bottom of [this page](http://www.scibuff.com/2010/01/30/international-space-station-reboost/) it looks like the altitude decreases by ~2 km per month. The reboost from OP's video (24 Jan 2010) looks like it increased the altitude by ~6 km, so it extended the orbit by another few (3?) months. (Keep in mind that this doesn't mean the station would re-enter 3 months later, it just means it would probably decay to the starting altitude by that point.) ----- &gt; is the ISS going to reentry It will re-enter if it goes too long without a re-boost. I'm not sure how long it would take. You can see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station#/media/File:Internationale_Raumstation_Bahnh%C3%B6he_(dumb_version\).png) that it has gone many months straight with no reboost. But you can also see that the decay rate increases as the altitude decreases. So even if it's decaying by ~2 km / month at 400 km, it's going to decay a lot faster at 300 km. Of course no one is going to let that happen while the station still has funding. But eventually they will let it re-enter in a controlled manner so that it burns up over an ocean or someplace uninhabited.","cudvgr6","cue54bl","cue2u79"

Zero-g removes convection currents from the equation, since convection currents are driven by density difference caused by temperature difference. What else could cause the exhaled air to mix with the room air? Brownian motion would eventually result in the gasses evenly distributing through the room, but it would take a long time. I think that you would need something like a fan to ""stir"" the air. Why don't people in the tropics have this problem? Maybe it is because even a very small temperature differential is enough to move the CO2 away from your face. So in gravity, you would need to be sleeping at ambient temperature very close to your body temperature. I don't know...","cudtjwp","cudywiu","cudyqmx"

Jumping out of an airplane you don't really get that, since you are moving forward at first, then the air reduces that forward speed while gravity increases your downward (until terminal velocity).

A negative delta V implies a decrease in velocity. What?? I have never seen it used that way. It doesn't make sense. For example, you can change your inclination such that your velocity changes by a non-zero amount, but your speed relative to Earth is unchanged (by burning perpendicular to the orbital plane). Your speed isn't increasing, so apparently the dV cannot be positive. But the speed isn't decreasing, so the dV cannot be negative either. But dV cannot be zero, since the velocity changed by a non-zero amount. Your explanation falls apart for any maneuvers which aren't purely prograde or retrograde.","cudttdm","cudxdht","cudw083"

An ""increasing delta V"" means that you are in the process of increasing your velocity magnitude (accelerating in the direction of your velocity), which is what ISS needs to do in order to raise its altitude. For a given spacecraft, fuel load and engine performance, there is a maximum delta V that it is capable of achieving by burning all its fuel. I think this is what you are assuming the astronaut was referring to. He was not. *Every* engine burn produces some delta V and as long as the engines are burning the delta V is changing.

Keep in mind that dV is used to describe orbital maneuvers *and* to describe how much fuel is remaining. I think he was just saying that the maneuver will literally accelerate the ISS by 2.8 m/s. (Of course, this is equivalent to saying it will use up 2.8 m/s of the ISS's dV, but that's a bit more abstract.

This is, for example, the resolution of the [twin paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox). Take two twins, one who stays on earth and another who takes off in a spaceship and travels very fast, before turning around and returning to earth. It's called a paradox because we could sit in the reference frame of either twin, and from each twin's perspective, the naive conclusion is that the *other* twin should be younger because the other twin is the one who traveled. This is incorrect, though, because the twin who left in the spaceship had to accelerate in order to speed up and then again to turn around and then slow down. The person on earth did *not* accelerate, but the one on the spaceship did. Another to see this is the following. If you're on a very smooth train with no windows, you would have no idea how fast you were moving. If the train ran smoothly enough, you wouldn't be able to tell whether you were moving or not. However, as anyone who has ever been on a train or in a car knows, the moment the train tries to *change* its speed (accelerate), you would fall in the opposite direction. You can measure your own acceleration without relying on an external reference frame; but you cannot measure your own speed in the same manner. *Acceleration is not relative.* We can have an apparent acceleration with respect to something else only in the sense that the distance between us is changing at a changing rate because the other thing is accelerating towards/away from us, but it is not a real acceleration.","cuduquh","cueby19","cue0wtq"

Firstly, the object used is too massive to be influenced by the pressure gradient caused by this acceleration. We would rather be talking about air drag. The air inside the ISS would push against the object and thus decrease the relative velocity between it and the ISS. In other terms, the object would slowly stop moving inside the ISS if there was enough room. However, again, the air drag (because of the density of the object and slow velocity) is negligible. To answer your question then, the camera is in fact moving in the ""direction of travel"" due to the air dragging it along with it. It's moving very very very very very slowly though. By the way, for the second paragraph, I am using a frame of reference that could be considered as a virtual ISS at v = v@t=0, which hasn't been subjected to thrust. Following this logic, the real ISS would technically have a ""direction of travel"" away from the virtual ISS.","cudw34j","cudy6ew","cudw34j"

The definition of Delta V is just that a Delta ( change ) in velocity .Usually when we talk about Delta V we dont talk about negative or positive changes in Velocity we only consider its magnitude because that's what really matters (the higher the Delta V magnitude the more fuel we have to burn ). This applies to whether you are increasing your velocity from an initial slower velocity or vice versa. The basic equation for Delta V is Delta V = |V1-V0| Where V0 is your initial Velocity and V1 is the velocity you wish to be at this can be higher than V0(speeding up) or lower than (slowing down) . It's the magnitude that matters since this is directly related to Isp and this directly related to the mass that you burn per Delta V manuaver I.e the higher the magnitude of Delta V, no matter whether you speed up or slow down still burns fuel !

We can actually calculate how much fuel this would require using the [Tsiolkovsky rocket equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation): dV = Isp * g * ln(M0/M1) * **dV**: the delta v is 2.7 m/s * **Isp**: the specific impulse is a property of the specific engine being used, ~~but most liquid fuel rocket engines have a specific impulse of around 450 s.~~ *E: they probably used either the [S5.79 or S5.80 engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S5.80), which has a specific impulse closer to 300 s.* (If you are curious, specific impulse is a measure of the speed of the exhaust gasses.) * **g**: standard acceleration of gravity (9.8 m/s^2) (Its purpose here is to convert from Isp to the exhaust gas velocity.) * **M0**: the mass before the burn is equal to the weight of the station itself (~450 000 kg) plus the weight of the fuel. * **M1**: the mass after the burn is just the weight of the station (without the fuel) 2.7 = 2940 * ln[ (450 000 + x) / 450 000 ] x = 413.5 kg So this maneuver required about ~~275~~ 400 kg of fuel.

If you had a tower cabinet you will see a difference in temperature at the top and bottom and in a server rack the difference in temperature can pose a problem. A tiny laptop on the other hand is not going to overheat because it is upside down and the difference in cooling is fairly negligible. What they might be concerned with on the other hand is dust buildup. Here on Earth most of the dust will fall to the ground and can easily be collected but in freefall the dust will just float around until it eventually gets filtered out by the ventilation system. You do not want this dust to collect on the heatsink and fans without the ability to clean them once in a while. Some laptops can be very hard to clean and might require a partial disassembly.

Transfer from initial LEO to circular 1000km orbit would be ~400 m/s (as opposed to 100 m/s currently for 400 km orbit). And we're talking one way, they would still need to burn at least another 300 to make a re-entry from there. So around 700 m/s to make round-trip. Space Shuttle had less than 400 m/s, Soyuz and Progress have ~400 m/s, although Progress can carry more fuel as part of payload but it would barely make it. I believe only the modified Progress M1 or ESA ATV would have enough fuel to reach the ISS at 1000km altitude and come back from there, but both were designed for refuelling the station and for reboosting it.","cue0s8m","cue565o","cue0s8m"

Basically, the engines they used for this maneuver were probably using [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsymmetrical_dimethylhydrazine) and [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitrogen_tetroxide), which makes them less efficient than an engine using liquid H2 and liquid O2 (therefore they need to burn more fuel to accomplish the same maneuver). But this mixture is advantageous because it is hypergolic, which means the two components will react upon mixing. If you are designing an engine that will be repeatedly started and stopped (e.g. for orbital corrections), it's much more reliable to have a fuel mixture that ignites on its own.

The container in this scenario is just the whole space station; if gases didn't expand, then there would be a vacuum or pressure difference somewhere.. and then gas would expand to fill that area. CO2 is almost twice as dense as air. Under gravity, that means that the CO2 will settle at the bottom of a container, and so as you breath, the CO2 falls away from your face. Also, since it would be moving, it'll mix with the rest of the air. The end result is that under gravity, CO2 from respiration doesn't really build up anywhere. In microgravity, fluids don't separate due to density differences - look at what happens when they blow bubbles in drops of water - it just goes wherever.

This is because I was in free fall for seven seconds. It felt like this because, when you fall, you experience the feeling of free fall for about seven seconds. This is because there is a feeling of freefall and, when you fall, you are in free fall for about seven seconds. Seriously though, free fall only last for about seven seconds because you reach terminal velocity due to air resistance. Constant velocity feels like being still.
