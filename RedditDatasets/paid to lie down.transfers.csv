Then he began talking about the new shower head, which had replaced an industrial sprayer of the type used by restaurant dishwashers. I wasn’t sure he did know what I meant, so I asked Leon. Leon confirmed that the shower was “where most of them do it.” As with astronauts in orbit, masturbation is not formally addressed in the FARU rules or orientation. Leon, being Leon, asked the unit psychologist. “I mean, if it’s something that would throw off the test or something, I wouldn’t do it.” The psychologist blushed and then gave Leon the go-ahead, leaving the logistics up to him.","cv15jeb","cv1bxxc","cv160fa"

This reading usually takes around an hour so you know in good detail what you're signing up for. Most studies are for drugs that are already approved but are just variations of the formulas, dosage or release methods. Obviously you can't know for sure if you'll have any side effects so there is some gamble to it. I've been doing studies for 5-6 years and only had one bad experience. It was an anti depressant and they are known to have bad side effects. I nearly threw up and spend the whole time there unable to sleep or orgasm and just feeling uncomfortable. Besides that and one pain killer study the most I usually feel for all other drugs I've taken are slight discomfort in my stomach.

You generally have to call in sick once or twice a week to work less than that, or play a game of bidding onto oldheads jobs while they're on vacation. The old guys with seniority held the jobs with off days and regular schedules. A lower seniority guy working on the on-call board could place a hold down on Ol' Whiskers job while they're away and earn a day off here and there, you had to be creative to get a day off basically. Not every railroad, but the larger class 1 freight railroads like Union Pacific and BNSF will work you as much as they can. 90 hour work weeks were not uncommon when I was a locomotive engineer, and I never worked less than 70 hours a week as a conductor. Those guys stay up against it and go hard for that money, I'm broke now but a lot happier having given up that profession. 24 hours on call, 7 days a week, with the exception of your vacation days you had no scheduled days off aside from Christmas. 349 days a year. The hours though.. I've been stuck on trains up to 32 hours when it melted down, got 6.5 hours off and I'm getting a call ""Be back to work in an hour and a half"" That run was a short day, only 13 hours. You always get the call in 6.5 to be back in 1.5, and it doesn't matter how many hours you last worked when you were on.","cv15jeb","cv21ptl","cv1zbqw"

It's not anywhere near as bad as you're making it out to be. Not to mention that he's now got this story to tell, working with NASA, currently semi-famous, and will no doubt make more money off of this. Also, in his particular case, he was an unemployed ""artist manager"". $18k is probably worth a lot to him, especially when you consider he'd have no expenses for those 70 days.

Ended up losing my job after passing out at work (construction). Since then I am in my bed for probably 23 hours in total. Sometimes I'll get out of the house tho. I just lay around watching anime and sometimes playing the elder scrolls online game. Sleep is so hard to do when you don't tire yourself out enough. Usually I can't sleep for a day to 2 and then I sleep for 16+ hours when I do fall asleep. My longest continuous sleep time was like 23 hours lol. I've been to the doctor a few times and it seemed to clear up last time for a little bit but the symptoms are back. Idk if it is pneumonia again or something else. I hate going to the hospital because I feel like a hypochondriac. I almost wish it was serious so I wouldn't feel so ashamed of it. Hopefully I either get better or die in my sleep soon lmao.","cv15jeb","cv1h85r","cv162yu"

Be that person! Maybe you're thinking ""no one will respond and it will be a waste of time."" I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Before I worked in the field, I approached my congressman with an idea to allow cell phone users to block numbers free of charge to deter harassment and stalking. They worked with me for over a month to explore the idea and see if it was a candidate for legislation. Ultimately, the legal battle of taking on cell phone providers was deemed too insurmountable and the bill went nowhere, but they explored my idea in depth and called me weekly with progress reports. It's easy to criticize a lack of regulations and say that the law should look a certain way, but remember that as a citizen in this democracy, you have a role to play in shaping our legal code.

There are 168 hours in a week, 40 of which can be paid at minimum wage, the other 128 would have to be paid at at least time and a half. So in an actual job he would have to be paid the equivalent of 232 hours, which over 10 weeks would be 2320 hours. That brings the hourly rate to $7.76. If this were a normal job that would be above federal minimum wage if he were also provided a healthcare plan, but below minimum wage if he wasn't provided a healthcare plan, and in several states below minimum wage in any instance. Of course this violates all sorts of other standard labor laws; this was under special circumstances, with a special agreement that surely fell under some type of contract work, rather than a normal employment situation. However, it's still interesting that he was compensated less than minimum wage(considering overtime rates), for such a difficult task, and for the government at that.","cv15jeb","cv1i9go","cv162yu"

Astronauts can't just go around overtly having sex in space. While it's not specifically addressed in NASA's code of conduct, ""Its Astronaut Code of Professional Responsibility includes a vague Boy Scout Oath–style pledge, 'We will strive to avoid the appearance of impropriety.'"" In the words of Mary Roach, ""to me, that just means, Don’t get caught."" Sexual arousal is a serious problem in space, especially on the longer missions. Luckily, there are other ways to deal with that. Another excerpt reads: &gt;Cosmonaut Alexandr Laveikin told me he too had heard that lengthy abstinence could cause prostate infections, but that the space agency pretends the issue doesn’t exist. “It’s up to yourself how you will deal with it. But everybody is doing it, everybody understands. It’s nothing. My friends ask me, ‘How are you making sex in space?’ I say, ‘By hand!’” (Seriously, it's an awesome and informative book that I can recommend if you like the nitty gritties of space missions)","cv15jeb","cv1spto","cv1pqdu"

First off, he was paid 17800, not 18000. Second, it wasn't 70 days, it was 108, because of the pre-and-post bed periods. That brings the pay to $6.87 per hour. But that's still misleading because it is including the time he slept. We actually know how much time he slept because he had a strict sleeping schedule, from 10:00pm to 6:00am. So, really, rather than 24 paid hours a day, we can consider it 18 paid hours a day, which comes out to $9.16 per hour. Lower than our original estimate, but higher than the previous one. But here's the thing. For another job, you may be entitled to overtime, in which you'd get paid an extra 50% minimum. This guy had 112 waking hours a day. If someone who's stated wage is $9.16 an hour worked that number of hours, they'd have to be paid overtime for at least 72 of them. Once this is factored in, his job would be comparable to a job paying $7.80 per hour.","cv1d47c","cv1d47c","3kwokk"

Our body is not build for being in bed for these insane amounts of time. While in hospital I experienced multiple problems just from being in the hospital that long. Skin problems, muscle weakening, difficulties finding a good vein etc etc. After a while I was to weak to walk. Which makes life just a bit more lousy than it already is. So you have to get therapy to become mobile again. Also when you stay in a very busy large academic medical center for that long you have largely increased chance of being infected by some kind of bug. Which, you guessed it, happened to me twice. Off course there's also the mental thing. Being in an hospital environment for that long does things to you. I really had to keep myself busy. Books, a laptop and an Ipad helped a lot. But there were bad days and weeks. There were days I wished I did not wake up. You do not want to stay in that mindset for to long. Luckily I am married to the nicest person on earth. Who experienced her own hell while I was admitted. Going to work and visit me every day only to come home in an empty house. In bed alone wondering whether I was going to make it. Seeing me in a coma and feeling utterly lost. I really feel she had it worse than me. Feel guilty about that.","cv1dec7","cv1dec7","3kwokk"
