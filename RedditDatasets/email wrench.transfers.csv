Further, by not having to launch a wrench or part that has to go through extra design to withstand the stresses of launch, which jacks up the price, they can actually afford to print wrenches multiple times over. Yes, they do have to launch the filament, but they no longer have to launch as many spare parts up to the station, saving space because now they could print the parts on demand, and the parts are cheaper because they don't have to go through the previously mentioned process of designing for launch.","cmzm3ak","cmzx8t8","cmzopzg"

Semiconductor dopants and extracting enough metal for wiring are probably going to be the worst part here. There's still a big hurdle to really printing 3D printers for space colonization: microchips. While some circuit boards can be 3D printed, doing even a basic microcontroller chip is well beyond any current printing technology.

For example if you're printing a rod that will have torque applied to it you'd want to print it horizontally instead of vertically so that the filaments run the length of the rod. As for tolerances, a well-calibrated printer and well-adjusted temperatures can help a lot. Overall though you're right, plastic extrusion parts almost never match the quality of alternatives and in many cases aren't adequate for practical use. If you're gentle with a tool you've printed it's usually passable but the tech still hasn't really advanced beyond the stage of ""immediate convenience"" to ""long term usefulness"".","cmzmgx7","cmzn77n","cmzmrej"

I'm pretty darn sure the engineers made sure that there are enough tools on board the ISS to perform any maintenance required. For all we know he could have even mentioned it in the context that it would be nice to have multiple ratchets. Maybe there were two people performing similar tasks at the same time and one of them had a ratchet and the other had a normal wrench so he said ""we need to have two of these"".

The cache of dildos eventually finds its way toward the earth's atmosphere and rains havoc upon different parts of the world, like the movie, Armageddon. They send a group of astronauts, with an overly conceived plan to destroy the machine, sending Ben Affleck and Steve Bushemi into space. As the two approach the machine, NASA figures out they can just send an email to turn off the machine, but is too late, as Affleck dies heroically in a wave of oncoming CGI dildos, choreographed by Michael Bay. However, Bushemi mans the 3D printer and starts refiring dildos again, like the machine gun in Armageddon. At the climax of the whole thing, they find the culprit behind the original email to the ISS was none other then Bushemi in a plot to rain the earth in dildos.

If a DMLS(direct metal laser sintering) machine is designed for space operations(which will be tricky to say the least, it makes good use of gravity), relatively high strength parts/components will be able to be printed out of all sorts of metallic alloys. Many challenges for such a process to become space ready though.","cmzpomp","cmzq3td","cmzpomp"

I don't think so. The polls say otherwise for one thing. You don't give the public enough credit, and resort to propaganda to trick them. Instead of sitting them down and explaining how much we can get done for how much money in one of two ways.
