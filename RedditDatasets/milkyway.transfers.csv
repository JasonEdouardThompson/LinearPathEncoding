If you've ever been a a decent dark-sky area on a Moonless night, you might have seen the Milky Way. It can look pretty impressive if the sky is truly dark and the air is clear, but when you do a long-exposure photo, that brings out much more detail and lots more faint stars. Foreground objects (like the grass in OP's photo) might look completely dark. Fiddling with image in Photoshop can bring out even more detail, and some people take several shots of the same scene and then use software to ""stack"" the images, which gives you even more fine detail.","cu1u6tg","cu2h5xl","cu2gbh7"

Better, more expensive sensors experience *less* noise. When you get up into the scientific level of imaging, noise is eliminated by cooling the sensor, either electronically or literally by bathing the thing in liquid nitrogen or something. Some serious amateur astrophotographers use electronically-cooled cameras, and I *think* I just read somewhere that Canon or somebody was coming out with a prosumer 35mm camera that had cooling. None of that is cheap, however. For the casual amateur, you either need to get a camera with a good *enough* sensor that doesn't go overboard on the noise (the ""serious amateur"" to prosumer level cameras from Nikon and Canon are all decent), or you can try reducing the noise in post production with Photoshop or whatever. Most digital cameras have some degree of control over the in-camera manipulation of the image that might reduce noise. For example, cameras like the Nikon D90 and above have the ability to set the level of noise reduction. This doesn't *physically* reduce the noise, but rather it's an in-camera Photoshop kinda thing. You might actually get *better* results by turning noise reduction OFF. I keep mine off because I can do a better job of it in Photoshop, the camera's algorithms are weak.","cu1u6tg","cu2syjx","cu2jisy"

You can crank up the ISO more, but the image starts getting noisy. &gt;How is the foreground bright and colorful as is the sky Because there was a teensy amount of light on the foreground. I assume it is light spill from some nearby source, but it probably looked nearly black to the naked eye. Some astro shooters will intentionally paint nearby foreground objects with a flashlight or strobe to light them up. Doesn't take a whole lotta light when you're exposing that long.

A phone ain't gonna cut it. The wide angle lens is necessary because with a ~30 second exposure, the Earth turns more than enough to make the stars show up as streaks, and the more magnification you use, the more that streaking becomes obvious. The less magnification (ie, a wide angle lens), the less obvious it is. So what you do is set the camera to ISO 1600 or faster, set about a 15-30 second exposure with the lens at F2.8 or wider.

I can't quite find specifics on your camera in particular, but, here are some things to increase your chances: * Find **the darkest** place you can. Especially if your camera struggles in low light. The darker, the better! Use something like [this](http://darksitefinder.com/maps/unitedstates-15color.html) if you don't know where to look. * Set your camera to manual mode that lets you control shutter speed, aperture, and ISO. Turn the dial on top to the ""M"" mode. * Set your shutter speed to something like 30s. You'll need a tripod to help hold it still. * Open your aperture as much as you possibly can. All the way to f3.4. * Set your ISO to the highest, 3200 on your camera I think * Enable manual focus and try and focus to infinity. You might need to point it at a light far away to nail it. * shoot raw files if your camera supports it. It'll help in post. * Patience! It takes months sometimes to get the shot. A dSLR will certainlyl help, but it's by no means necessary. Try your cam! It might work out!","cu1u6tg","cu2bck6","cu28x0x"

If you're having trouble, post the file (or PM it to me!) and I'll try and help out. Cameras are much better at saving highlight detail versus shadow detail (since shadow details there's no information to begin with, and highlights is _too much_ information). Overexposing is actually a really common method of bringing out more detail in the sky when there's more light pollution. As for OP's photo, it doesn't look stacked, rather, he used a flashlight (note the blue-tinge of the light, I suspect an LED. Also, the strong focus of the light and the sharp cutoff on the surrounding area) to illuminate the grass in front of him. The stars do not emit a lot of light onto the ground and for you to be able to see the milky way this clearly, the moon cannot be bright enough to help out either, so, you could expose for many minutes and likely never get the ground properly lit. At that point, the sky will be way overexposed and blurry, too. Try splashing a little light onto a foreground object with your phone or a flashlight. Keep the source of the light (the LED) behind the camera or out of the frame to prevent flaring and a hotspot (you'll end up drawing a sharp line in the air a la light painting) on your image. Just shoot the light out from behind your camera like you're spray-painting it on the ground. Try and light every surface evenly to keep it natural looking, and don't hold the light too still for too long. You don't need to continuously light the surface throughout the photograph, just a quick pass here and there. If you need more light, make a second or third pass, or just go a little slower. It requires some practise, but you can get it easily! Lastly (since this post isn't long enough!), careful with those 30s exposures. In astrophotography, you need to adhere to the ""rule of 600"" that says your exposure shouldn't be longer than 600 / focal length of your lens. Else your stars will come out blurry. Hopefully this helps you or someone else passing through! Keep trying. I've been photographing the milky way for over a year and can say I've only just now started getting shots that weren't total and utter crap. :)","cu1u6tg","cu22dpx","cu21vdx"
