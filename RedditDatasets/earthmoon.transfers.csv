Farming, and even breathing, on Mars, will require modern technology. A human being could never stay there without a space suit, or being inside a building that is essentially a very large space suit. Eventually, the ones who made those technologies will be dead. That is a very fragile existence. There have been many mass extinction events here on the Earth. But so far, every time, life has found a way. But that's because life was built here.

Picture from 2003 from Mars Orbiter Camera - ""as you would see it in person if you look thru telescope from Mars"". I found this most amazing: &gt;Note that because the Moon is almost directly behind the Earth, a telescopic observer on Mars would see almost exactly the same lunar features that an observer on Earth would see at this point in time. In the following days after this image was taken, the views of the Moon as seen from Earth and Mars would diverge sharply. An observer on Earth would continue to see the same side (near side) of the Moon, while the Moon's phase would continue to grow (""wax"") as it approached full moon about one week later; by contrast, an observer on Mars would continue to see the Moon maintain very nearly the same phase, but would see it rotate (from left to right). About two weeks later (halfway around in its orbit), the Moon would once appear to be very close to the Earth, but in front of it rather than behind, and the far side rather than the near side would be visible.","cu0j40c","cu0mfzj","cu0j40c"

Once you do the math (and as evidenced by the many simulated Mars stay studies), you don't need that much food (no need to eat reprocessed shit) and water is pretty easy to reprocess with good efficiencies, as well as available on the surface of Mars both in the regolith and as subsurface ice.","cu0l0x5","cu0wrdu","cu0wfin"

Well, between 1958 and 2011 (that's 53 years) NASA's budget has been 526.18 billion - hardly trillions. That works out to about 10 billion a year. *source: Wikipedia* &gt;we should have a Hubble level high res webcam live stream 24/7 from the moon instead of all this blurry shoddy, composite stuff. If you are standing miles and miles away from a mountain and take a look through binoculars, you will get some pretty great resolution on what you are seeing. Consider that an analogy for looking at some of the huge stellar phenomena that we have observed (Galaxies, Nebulae). Now, trying to get this HD stream of the moon or another planet in our solar system would be like trying to then focus on a grain of dust that's a millimeter or a centimeter away from your eye. Go ahead, give it a try. I doubt you're going to get that crystal clear HD resolution you're talking about. You might be able to tell that its there but its definitely not going to be crystal clear. And to try to get an image of a planet in orbit around a star is like trying to see a grain of dust circling an illuminated lightbulb sitting at the top of that mountain you were looking at earlier. Sizes and distances involved in the universe are so mind boggling and beyond our perception that it's understanding if there is some confusion there. There is no way given the current budget for NASA that we *should* have a moon base or a man on Mars at this point. Until some radical new scientific discoveries are made, the cost of such a project is immense. The potential is definitely there but I wouldn't be blaming NASA for your disappointments.","cu0te54","cu1haiu","cu16wgu"

Mary Roach's book *Packing for Mars* pretty strongly conveys that current rocket technology means the return trip would require shit consumption. Buzzfeed (sorry) [sums up the current situation up this way](http://www.buzzfeed.com/danvergano/mars-aint-never-gonna-happen): &gt; Mars makes Antarctica look like paradise, with a near vacuum atmosphere, radiation as intense as multiple chest X-rays, temperatures that average -67 degrees Fahrenheit, and toxic chlorinated hydrocarbons carpeting its cratered surface. No technology exists today to survive under these conditions, let alone a human body. Mars One’s engineers say they can overcome those natural barriers with a crew habitat made of six modified SpaceX Dragon space capsules equipped with inflatable greenhouses. The trouble is, according to Do’s report, the plants growing the colonists’ food would quickly make too much oxygen and suffocate them. That’s just one of many fatal problems. Spare parts, for example, would take up 62% of the mission’s supplies. And the colony’s intended water supply — H2O baked out of that chlorinated Martian soil — relies on a technology that hasn’t been invented yet. Apollo was easy because it's only meals for 3 people for 10 days, so they never really left the Earth's biosphere. On Mars, you have to create your own biosphere, and we have no experience at running one. My best guess is that our propulsion systems are the dam that could break and solve this. A quantum leap in propulsion technology - via fusion, laser beam propulsion, or something else not yet dreamed up - will probably kick everything into gear because it makes the solutions to all other problems much cheaper.","cu0l0x5","cu0xh12","cu0wrdu"

There are people alive today who were born before space travel was even a possibility. Young civilizations, just like young people, make mistakes. But what's important to remember is that a young civilization is FAR older than any human can comprehend in normal terms. A human had 80 years to get right before death. But a civilization has THOUSANDS of years. We're still finding ourselves, and figuring it out. We're slowly (but surely) phasing out racism, sexism and bigotry. We're realizing our negative impacts on the environment and making REAL efforts to fix it. It's easy for us (as humans) to look at our current situation and think ""Nothing is changing!"". But things move slower for civilizations. change takes generations, not years. We need people to take an active interest, and to be curious about our world. We need people to recognize ""what we've done is GREAT! But we can do it better!"". Humanity will get there. And it's easy, to look at today, or this year, or this decade and think ""man, we are such a disaster. No one is working together, everyone's greedy, nothing is changing..."". But you've gotta take a step back, and realize that WE as a SPECIES are much bigger than we as an individual can comprehend. Compare the year 1015 with 1515, and 1915 with 2015. **We are growing. We slip, we stumble, and we make mistakes... But we're getting there. Nothing has stopped us yet.

So unless we can setup a self sustaining, large, and diverse colony on a dead planet in under a year or two, no we wouldnt escape catastrophe. And remember mankind was knocked down to 10k individuals at one point in our genetic history and its had LONG negative impacts on our genetic diversity.

During a new moon, the Moon is between the Earth and the Sun. Since the Moon orbits counterclockwise (when viewed from the north), that means it would be behind Earth (from this perspective) during first quarter. Of course, this is all assuming that this picture was taken with north pointing up. If it was taken the other way around, and then flipped (which is what NASA generally does with [this photo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_8#/media/File:As08-16-2593.jpg)), then everything would be reversed, and the Moon would be in the foreground.

We came about late, so asteroid impacts are relatively rare (relative to the begining). Our Solar System is calm, with Jupiter helping to protect us. we have an enormous moon. Not to mention we have mars right there. We've been a space faring civilization for less than 100 years, and we're already preparing to send people there. It'll tough, but I think we've been dealt a great hand. Safety from catastrophic events (from the moon and Jupiter). Tidal forces from the moon. Mars as an ""easy"" secondary home. It didn't have to be that way. We could easily imagine a solar system in which there exists a planet in the habitable zone, but with no large gas giant like Jupiter in the outer solar system. Or maybe it doesn't have a moon (like Venus doesn't). Or maybe it has all of those things, but intelligent life never sprung up. Or maybe intelligent life DID spring up, but the have no moon to practice space travel on. No secondary planet to colonize. Thus, if they want to survive as a species, they have to make the jump to be an interstellar capable species before being able to colonize other worlds. And what's sad, is that, given the size of the universe... There are probably civilizations like that. Maybe their planet orbits a star that isn't part of a galaxy (they exist). As they develop intelligence, space wouldn't even be considered something interesting. the night sky would be pitch black. No astronomy, no rocket scientists... Sure, at some point they'd discover the wonders of our universe, but think of how much longer it'd take? And think of how lonely it'd be for them. A pitch black night sky, with faint lights of distant galaxies and possible other planets. I think Humans have been given as good of an opportunity as we could have hoped for. And yes, we could be doing better, but I'm excited for where we are headed. I have faith that we can work through our problems here, and out there. I may never live to see it, but I faith that humanity will never die. I believe our spirit, coupled with our celestial opportunities will carry us into a brighter future. #EDIT: In response to a lot of comments: **We, as a species, are still so young.

It's not the moon that keeps our core molten, it's mainly a combination of leftover heat from formation (the mantle is a great insulator) and radioactive decay. ThinK about Venus, which is as geologically active as a planet can be, yet no moon. And Mercury, which is only 50m kms from the sun yet geologically dead. Mars ""died"" because its mantle isn't thick enough to insulate the core. Mars' core itself most likely also doesn't contain nearly as many heavy radioactive elements as earth's and Venus' respective planetary cores. This is why Mars lost its magnetosphere and atmosphere, not its lack of a sizeable moon. What the moon is good for, is stabilising our rotation. Without the moon, earth would likely have massive seasonal swings and a far more pronounced orbital ""wobble"". The tidal forces on Io are way more extreme than those imparted between the earth and moon and vice versa, or even earth and sun.

As you said, people will die on generation ships, people will die on Earth, and (surprise!) people will even die on the planets we colonize eventually. That's how it goes. Yea. And? These are the kind of things that would have to be explained if it really came down to it. It's not all black and white like you think. Humans are emotional beings. They want the best for the species, but they more immediately want the best for their families. It would be harder than you think to leave loved ones to die, even if ""everyone is going to die anyway"". That's just stupid to think otherwise. It's not a logical consideration, its emotional. The logical consideration there is that people are, in fact, very emotional. What about a situation where everyone staying on Earth had a year to live, while everyone on the ship had the rest of their life (the fact that the rest of their life may be miserably spent in a tin can is beside the point)? I'm just saying it's not so easy, even besides the engineering feats required.","cu0l0x5","cu0vxtl","cu0vnf6"

With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.

It helps keep our core molten, which in turn leads to Earth having a magnetosphere, shielding us from deadly solar radiation. Without such a large moon, we wouldn't be here at all.

The current era of Musk-led optimism reminds me of the happy talk at the beginning of the Space Shuttle era, about how people were inevitably headed to space (50 flights a year, and dirt cheap). We haven't even done a proof of concept for a short-term stay on Mars. There is no proof we could do it at 1G in a desert on Earth somewhere. The long trip out and, if not staying, the long trip back (probably eating your own shit - reprocessed) add up to a length of time in which one might well die from bone loss alone. I don't mind if we do a mission to Mars, but I wish the happy talk were based on a couple of experimental colonies in a desert somewhere, or on a moon base. For the present it's just talk. Can humans even run a self-contained colony **on Earth** in which re-supply orders have an 18- to 36-month delivery lag, and for which water must be extracted from rock on-site and food grown on-site, with equipment within the weight limit of what can be flown on a half-dozen Hohmann-transfer missions.","cu0l0x5","cu0uwe3","cu0u17w"

Part of the problem is that all of us live on one spaceship right now. If there is a problem with the life support (climate change, desertification) or a collision with a piece of space debris (killer asteroid) or someone blows up the damn thing (nuclear war, biological weapons) or a virulent uncurable disease breaks out, we're fucked. So as a species it is in our best interest to make more spaceships (e.g. colonize and terraform Mars) so that doesn't happen.","cu0l0x5","cu0vil1","cu0pg14"

You can't conclude anything on the basis of that small discrepancy. In actuality the distance of the Moon from the Earth is about a thousand times smaller than the distance of Mars from the Moon, so any discrepancy would be far smaller than the one you calculated, and smaller than this image could distinguish. No idea what your argument about the shadows on the Moon and Earth was supposed to be. Both will appear to be in the same amount of shadow, because they're both lit (virtually) from the same direction (the Sun).","cu0nc4b","cu0xu8f","cu0oghd"
