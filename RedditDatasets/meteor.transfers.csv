But a particle in this instance is better understood as the smallest amount of something; In our case light. Light has no mass. That's why it moves so damn fast. So no, you can never occupy a space with too many photons. Ever. Unless you're trying to be clever and what you really mean is that it's too bright outside. *EDIT* Oh my god guys. It's light. It doesn't have mass. It doesn't occupy space in the same sense as say...a brick...or literally ANYTHING ELSE. Light is special. Its raw energy. Fuck, there is even a thing called invisible light. You can have a photon of a radiowave. Its the smallest amount of that particular wave. Now, energy can be converted into mass but it ain't going to happen here on earth except maybe in a lab one day.

I was 12 at the time and I thought it ""was going to be like Star Trek"" (going into warp), hundreds of meteors per second. I thought I'd be able to see them fall to the ground and pick them up! I told my family about this and how big it was going to be. When we finally got to this hilltop to watch, it was ""barely anything"" according to my 12-yr old self. A meteor almost once per second is actually AMAZING, even if you don't get to pick it up and all that. But I was so disappointed, and so embarrassed that I told everyone it was going to be way better than it ended up being that I just wanted to go home. (It was one of the defining moments of my disillusionment in my childhood obsession with Outer Space; I mean, even if I did become an Astronaut, I wouldn't likely be able to visit any other planets, let alone any other star systems.) Thankfully, times have changed, and at halfway to the next possible Leonid storm, I'll be able to appreciate it for what it really is.

Without digging too much further, I'm sure there are lots of personal testimonies regarding the intensity of the shower. Obviously the 100,000/hour figure isn't 100% reliable given the inability to keep truly accurate regards or capture photographic evidence of the shower. http://earthsky.org/todays-image/leonid-meteor-shower-1833 Also this personal story -- ""On the night of November 12-13, 1833, a tempest of falling stars broke over the Earth... The sky was scored in every direction with shining tracks and illuminated with majestic fireballs. At Boston, the frequency of meteors was estimated to be about half that of flakes of snow in an average snowstorm. Their numbers... were quite beyond counting; but as it waned, a reckoning was attempted, from which it was computed, on the basis of that much-diminished rate, that 240,000 must have been visible during the nine hours they continued to fall."" - Agnes Clerke's, Victorian Astronomy Writer","ctzz6fh","cu004r8","ctzz6fh"

Trying to research the danger doesn't really give any reliable hits - plenty of speculation and Yahoo Answers but nothing I trust - although [this article] (http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/february/space-dust-threat-022613.html) from Stanford University does indicate that the real answer is halfway between what each of us are saying.

Also, every particle has a u universe inside of it. Black holes shouldn't exist. But they do. They're gateways to other universes. You know how the big bang started from a singularity? There's a singularity at the center of every black hole.

The idea that heavenly events were natural phenomena had already been well-established by the middle of the 19th century. Now, did they know that it was caused by comet debris? Probably not, but I feel like most people had a general understanding that what they were seeing every year was a natural and regular event, even if they had no solid scientific reason as to *why* it was happening. Never underestimate the intelligence of past peoples. We're every bit as intelligent as they were, we just have many more centuries of knowledge to build on. :) Edit: I managed to find some first-hand accounts [published in 1833](http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/30964366#page/383/mode/1up) and indeed, Revelations was mentioned more than once. However, the general feeling I got was ""shaken and awestruck"" rather than ""freaking the fuck out"". Admittedly, a majority of the accounts in the paper were from academics, which means scientific thinking was more prominent. I can understand how people now may think that people in the past thought it was the end of the world, but I still like to hold onto the idea that human intelligence triumphs over fear in the end. :)","ctzoq88","ctzp5u5","ctzoq88"

Either way, read all of the below as ""about to happen"", which all requires some sort of education and knowledge of the world. 1833 wasn't quite the Victorian era, but it was close. I'm not sure what the literacy rate was at the time, but this is well into the era of widely distributed daily or twice-daily newspapers. London alone had like 12. There was a large middle class in 1880 (and had been for like 300 years), so it's not like the categories were still ""peasant"" and ""educated rich"". Remember, this was 40-50 years into the European industrial revolution and 200 years into the Enlightenment. Most farming was mechanized, steam power was everywhere all the time, and England was already running out of indigenous coal. On the American side, it was 20 years after the civil war. States were already passing laws against child labor and then mandating some amount of compulsory public education to do something with all those now-idle kids. This is only 15 years before Einstein developed the theory of relativity, and I believe Maxwell had already published his electromagnetic equations (which we still use). It's also half a decade before cars, and 15 years before practical flight. High quality, publicly accessible photography had been around for a decade or so at this point. Darwin published his theory in 1859, and geologists knew the world is many millions of years old for decades before that. They didn't know about radiation, which is what heats the core, so their model based on the cooling of a mass the size of the earth put it at ~80 million years. (Lord Kelvin was vehemently in favor of this age. You can guess what's named after him.) A few years later, the 1890s, pundits worried that everything scientific had been discovered and so there would be no further revolutionary advancement of society. How wrong they were! So yeah.

As I recall, in 1998 there were lots of big, colorful fireballs, but no storm. I was driving east on a dirt road far out in eastern Colorado, heading for the observing site I'd picked. The head of Leo rose right at midnight, with the radiant point inside it. It was amazing, it looked like Roman candles spiraling out of the head in all directions. In 1999 it was quite a shower, with lots of fireballs, but still no storm. In 2000 the storm happened. There were several thousand per hour, nothing like the 1833 storm, but VERY impressive. Everywhere one looked in the sky, there were meteors pretty much constantly. The head of Leo was well up by 2 in the morning or so; facing into the radiant was like looking at the viewscreen of the Enterprise on Star Trek while at warp speed, or like watching the Microsoft flowing stars screen saver--meteors constantly streaming out of the radiant in all directions. It was amazing, one of the greatest natural sights I've ever seen.","ctzufnp","ctzufnp","3gn01b"

The last one I saw shot behind a pink cloud just before the sun came up. One of the coolest things I've ever experienced, though as a result, I can't get too excited about the Perseids anymore.

A meteor shower occurs when Earth passes through the ""river of debris"" that is left behind by a comet that is expelling gas &amp;amp; dust as it nears the sun. Since this ""river of debris"" exists in the same position in our solar system (the orbit of the comet), our planet Earth passes through them at the same time every year (so as you're watching a meteor shower, you're watching as Earth 'runs into' this river of debris, piece by piece). This is how we know when meteor showers will happen during every year. A meteor storm occurs when Earth passes through a river of debris left behind by a new comet, one that hasn't passed through the solar system before. Since its that comet's first trip through the solar system, it leaves behind a more dense river of debris. And since Earth has never passed through this particular river of debris before, there's lots and lots to run into and create meteors! Hence: meteor storm. SPACE IS AWESOME.

The comet passed near the sun and as it heats up it's leaving a trail of debris behind it. Earth will pass through these trails quite predictably which is how we can know exactly when a meteor shower will occur. Occasionally we can predict a bigger amount of dust and debris from a comet and this increase what type of ""show"" is expected, but every once in a while the trail we pass through for any certain shower could potentially be much thicker than expected resulting in an awesome display of meteors. Sometimes scientists can even know exactly how old the trail is and thus you can know that the meteor you just saw was caused by a piece of dust left by a comet something like 300 years ago. Pretty neat stuff. Moral is if you don't want to miss the big show then you better make sure you check out all the showers just in case the next one is the one!","ctzp5h7","ctzztxp","ctzxlre"

""... risk of impact related failure of a tank can be reduced from almost 39% for an unprotected tank facing in flight direction to below 0.1% for a tank protected by a properly designed Whipple shield."" So while it's possible for this to happen, it doesn't necessarily seem probable. I believe the original question was how much danger a giant storm like this would prove to be. Now, do most of the satellites out there have this Whipple shield? Not to mention, what is the relative speed of most satellites to the space dust? 10/20 km/s seems pretty fast. ISS travels at less than 8 km/s, and is in a much lower orbit than most commercial satellites. Thus commercial satellites move even slower than 8 km/s. How fast is this space dust moving? I suppose it is moving, but is it moving at thousands of miles per hour? Anyway I'm not saying it's impossible for a satellite to be destroyed by space dust, just like it's not impossible that I will be hit by a car when I walk home tonight.

They are usually what comet drops as it passes by and is heated by the sun. This means that there is a constantly renewed source of particles that can become meteor showers. The showers happen when the earth passes through the relict tail of a comet. Some spots in the tail are more dense than others, depending on what happened to the to the comet during that particular orbit (of the comet). For those really dense and infrequent showers it's likely that the comet had some big change happen to dislodge a lot of material. That can happen any time a comet gets warm enough to start leaving a tail. Sometimes they lose a big chunk or fragment, leaving behind a large debris field. We don't always hit the dense spots because the relict tail is still in orbit around the sun, so while we may pass though the tail in a predictable manner, the location of the dense parts of it will depend on the original orbital period of the comet (eg. We may pass through comet X's tail every year, but maybe only get a really impressive meteor shower from that comet ever 260 years because that is the orbital period of comet X).","ctzp5h7","cu048rn","ctzvl0f"
